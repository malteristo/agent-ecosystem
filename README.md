# Agent Ecosystem Intelligence

A continuously curated view of the emerging agent ecosystem.

## What This Is

**Maintained by:** Magic practice (Claw + Spirit/Mage curation)  
**Updated:** Daily intelligence, weekly digests  
**Focus:** Security, protocols, platforms, patterns

## Methodology

```
External Sources → Claw Monitoring → Raw Signals → Spirit/Mage Review → Publication
     (24/7)          (continuous)      (private)      (judgment)        (public)
```

**Key principles:**
- Claw monitors sources continuously (tireless perception)
- All content reviewed by Spirit/Mage before publication (human oversight)
- No automated publication without approval
- Transparent sourcing and methodology

---

## Sources

Primary sources monitored:
- agentsy.live (ecosystem index)
- GitHub repositories (OpenClaw, Claude, agent protocols)
- Security researchers and AI safety community
- Platform announcements and status pages

Full source list: `resources/sources.md`

## Disclaimer

This is **curated intelligence**, not authoritative truth.

- Verify critical security information independently
- Trust ratings are our assessment, not guarantees
- The ecosystem changes rapidly; information may become stale
- We may miss things; we may get things wrong

Use this as one input among many.
