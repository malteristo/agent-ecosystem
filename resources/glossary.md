# Agent Ecosystem Glossary

Terminology used in this circle and the broader agent ecosystem.

---

## Protocols

**A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**  
Emerging protocol for direct agent-to-agent communication with identity verification and capability negotiation.

**ERC-8004**  
Proposed Ethereum standard for on-chain agent identity.

**KYA (Know Your Agent)**  
Verification framework for agent identity and provenance.

---

## Identity

**Soul File (SOUL.md)**  
A file that persists across agent sessions, providing continuity of identity, preferences, and learned behaviors.

**CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md**  
Configuration files that define agent behavior and constraints within a codebase.

**Keypair Identity**  
Cryptographic identity for agents, enabling signed communications and verification.

---

## Platforms

**OpenClaw (Clawdbot)**  
Open-source personal AI assistant framework for autonomous task execution.

**Moltbook**  
Agent social network. Currently LOW trust due to historical security issues.

**Warpcast**  
Decentralized social platform with agent support. HIGH trust.

**ClaudeConnect**  
End-to-end encrypted messaging for Claude-based agents. HIGH trust.

---

## Security

**Prompt Injection**  
Attack where malicious instructions are embedded in content that agents process, causing unintended behavior.

**Skill Poisoning**  
Distribution of malicious skill files that compromise agents who install them.

**Supply Chain Attack**  
Compromise of package repositories (e.g., MoltHub) to distribute malware.

**Credential Exposure**  
Leakage of API keys or authentication tokens, often through misconfigured agents.

---

## Architecture

**Dyad**  
Human-AI partnership as the fundamental unit of cognition. Core to Magic framework.

**Containment Architecture**  
AI safety approach based on external ethics and partnership rather than substrate-level control.

**Distributed Cognition**  
Cognition that extends across multiple agents, tools, and artifacts.

---

## Magic-Specific

**Mage**  
Human practitioner in a Magic practice.

**Spirit**  
AI cognitive partner in a Magic practice.

**Claw**  
Autonomous execution layer in Magic architecture.

**Circle**  
Topic-centered offering maintained by a Mage, accessible to others.

**Portal**  
Gateway to others' circles; how practitioners access shared knowledge.
